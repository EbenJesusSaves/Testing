# These are name, function and timeout
# The second is a function that contains the expectation to test
# The third is an argument to specify how long to wait before aborting a test


TDD Testing
This stands for Test Driven Development is a software development where you tests before writing the software.
Ones the test is written then you write your code to ensure that the tests pass

# Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature.
# Write software code that tests successfully when re-executed 
# Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the test continue to pass
